# Best Practices

This page provides recommendations on how to use QitOps effectively.

## General Best Practices

### Configuration Management

- **Use Version Control**: Store your test configurations in a version control system like Git.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Use environment-specific configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Parameterize Configurations**: Use variables and environment variables to parameterize your configurations.
- **Validate Configurations**: Use the JSON schema validation feature to validate your configurations.

### Test Organization

- **Group Related Tests**: Group related tests into collections or directories.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for your tests and collections.
- **Include Descriptions**: Include descriptions for your tests and collections to document their purpose.
- **Tag Tests**: Use tags to categorize tests for easier filtering and reporting.

### CI/CD Integration

- **Use CI Mode**: Use the `--ci-mode` flag when running tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Generate Reports**: Generate reports in a format that can be consumed by your CI/CD system.
- **Set Exit Codes**: Use exit codes to determine the success or failure of your tests.
- **Store Artifacts**: Store test results and reports as artifacts for historical analysis.

## API Testing Best Practices

### Test Design

- **Test Happy Paths**: Test the expected behavior of your API.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Test edge cases and error conditions.
- **Test Performance**: Test the performance of your API under different loads.
- **Test Security**: Test the security of your API.

### Request Configuration

- **Set Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for your requests.
- **Configure Retries**: Configure retries for transient failures.
- **Set Headers**: Set appropriate headers for your requests.
- **Validate Responses**: Validate response status codes, headers, and bodies.

### Collections

- **Define Dependencies**: Define dependencies between requests to create test workflows.
- **Capture Data**: Capture data from responses to use in subsequent requests.
- **Use Variables**: Use variables to parameterize your requests.
- **Set Default Headers**: Set default headers for all requests in a collection.

## Performance Testing Best Practices

### Test Design

- **Define Clear Objectives**: Define clear performance objectives for your tests.
- **Start Small**: Start with a small number of users and gradually increase.
- **Test Different Scenarios**: Test different scenarios to understand the performance characteristics of your system.
- **Monitor System Resources**: Monitor system resources during performance tests.

### Load Profiles

- **Use Appropriate Load Profiles**: Use appropriate load profiles for your tests (constant, ramping, spike).
- **Set Realistic Ramp-Up Times**: Set realistic ramp-up times to avoid overwhelming your system.
- **Define Thresholds**: Define thresholds for pass/fail criteria.
- **Use Tags**: Use tags to categorize metrics for detailed analysis.

## Security Testing Best Practices

### Test Design

- **Define Security Requirements**: Define clear security requirements for your tests.
- **Test Different Scan Types**: Test different scan types to identify different types of vulnerabilities.
- **Set Severity Thresholds**: Set severity thresholds for pass/fail criteria.
- **Regular Testing**: Perform security tests regularly to identify new vulnerabilities.

### Authentication

- **Test Authentication**: Test authentication mechanisms to ensure they are secure.
- **Test Authorization**: Test authorization to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to access.
- **Test Input Validation**: Test input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- **Test Error Handling**: Test error handling to ensure sensitive information is not leaked.

## Web Testing Best Practices

### Test Design

- **Test Different Browsers**: Test your web application in different browsers.
- **Test Different Devices**: Test your web application on different devices.
- **Test Responsive Design**: Test your web application's responsive design.
- **Test Accessibility**: Test your web application's accessibility.

### Test Automation

- **Use Selectors**: Use selectors to identify elements on the page.
- **Set Wait Conditions**: Set wait conditions to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.
- **Capture Screenshots**: Capture screenshots to document test results.
- **Test User Flows**: Test common user flows to ensure they work as expected.

## AI Features Best Practices

### Test Generation

- **Provide Clear Descriptions**: Provide clear descriptions when generating tests.
- **Review Generated Tests**: Review generated tests to ensure they meet your requirements.
- **Customize Generated Tests**: Customize generated tests to fit your specific needs.
- **Use as Starting Points**: Use generated tests as starting points for more complex tests.

### Test Analysis

- **Analyze Test Results**: Analyze test results to identify patterns and issues.
- **Implement Suggestions**: Implement improvement suggestions to enhance your tests.
- **Combine with Manual Analysis**: Combine AI analysis with manual analysis for comprehensive insights.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Use analysis results to iterate and improve your tests.

## Data-Driven Testing Best Practices

### Test Design

- **Use Appropriate Data Formats**: Use appropriate data formats (CSV, JSON) for your tests.
- **Structure Data Properly**: Structure your data properly to ensure it can be used effectively.
- **Include Edge Cases**: Include edge cases in your data to test boundary conditions.
- **Parameterize Tests**: Parameterize your tests to use data from external sources.

### Test Execution

- **Set Iteration Limits**: Set limits on the number of iterations to avoid long-running tests.
- **Configure Stop-on-Failure**: Configure whether to stop on failure or continue with other iterations.
- **Generate Detailed Reports**: Generate detailed reports for each iteration.
- **Analyze Aggregate Results**: Analyze aggregate results to identify patterns and issues.
